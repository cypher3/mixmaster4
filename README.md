Mixmaster 4.0
=============

Introduction
------------

Mixmaster is software that provides a way for anyone to send completely anonymous and untraceable email.  Mixmaster is one of the oldest privacy protecting technologies on the Internet and has been in use consistantly since the mid-1990's. Using the software, victims of crimes, informants, whistleblowers, or anyone who wishes to protect the privacy of their communications can do so easily, reliably, and with assurance.

What is Mixmaster 4.0?
----------------------

Mixmaster 4.0 is an attempt to revamp the Mixmaster software and integrate modern coding standards and technologies into the software. The developers intend to fix a number of longstanding issues as well as implement much needed 'updates' including the ability to use larger, up to 4096 bit, encryption keys.

Who is behind Mixmaster 4.0?
----------------------------

- Lance Contrell
- John Perry
- Anthony Papillion

If you've been involved in Mixmaster for any length of time, you'll immediately recognize Lance and John as the original developers of Mixmaster while Anthony is a relative newcommer to the technology and will be assisting in coding.
